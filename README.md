ExtraHealth - Plugin I made by request

By default, you will craft an extra heart with 4x Netherite scrap in corners, an elytra in the center, and 4 ender pearls in the other slots. Feel free to change this as this seems a bit overpriced if you don't have craftable elytras, like they do (sadly).

Dying will lose you a heart, with the minimum hearts being 3 which you can't drop below.

You can have a max of 10 extra hearts if you craft them.
