# ExtraHealth
A minecraft with a twist plugin I made by request

### Features
ExtraHealth adds a layer of difficulty to otherwise easy gameplay. When you die, you permanently lose a heart.

The only way to gain health in this plugin so far is to craft them. 

To craft a heart you will need:
- 4x Netherite Scrap
- 4x Ender Pearls
- 1x Elytra

Feel free to change the crafting recipe if it seems expensive, the server I made this for had craftable elytras (unfortunately)

You can have a max of 10 extra hearts if you craft them.

### Admin Commands
I added admin commands! (incredible)

The commands are below, and are self-explanatory (All amount values are in HP, not hearts).
```
/addhealth <player> <amount>
/removehealth <player> <amount>
/checkhealth <player>
/sethealth <player> <amount>
```
